# welcome-to-the-world

Just an ordinary man fulfilling his dreams. Kleine's here and I enjoy using Java.
I just love coding or making programs while having a cup of coffee.
I'm 19 years old, was born on October 24, 1998 and I'm still studying Information Technology here at Nueva Vizcaya State University-Bambang Campus, Philippines.
